# Dashboards
This is my analysis and first visualization using Excel
You can also download the data from https://www.mediafire.com/file/t3cfobm8ur1jmhb/Excel+Dashboard.xlsx/file

This analysis can be done in no time. All you have to is format the cells as a table. If you download the raw data directly from my repository, you won't have to format as table(I have done that already). But if you want to get it done yourself, all from the scratch, click the download link. 
Note: the questions to answer with this dataset is included in the files I upload here. You wouldn't find the questions if you follow the download link.
The next process after #5 above is to insert a pivot table. 
Next, from the Pivot table, you can create your analysis and Visualizations
